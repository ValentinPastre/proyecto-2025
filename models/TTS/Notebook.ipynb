The raccoon becomes excited.or perhaps I am merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.The raccoon has taken to following me.You could say that we have gotten quite used to each other.The raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.Every time I brandish my cutting knife the raccoon shows me its excitement.A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread. '"
